# Gaussian Sonificator / Visualisator  
Based on the gauss method (SuperCollder).  
1st and 2nd TouchOSC Sliders are controling the arguments (Gaussian receiver & Standard Deviation). The 3rd one controls the generation speed of the next value (fast - slow).
  
  
**Visuals are coming soon (Open Frameworks).**

1) Load .touchosc layout on TouchOSC
2) Make sure the connection is ok (IP - port) via ON/OFF button (it will start to generate values)
3) Enjoy
