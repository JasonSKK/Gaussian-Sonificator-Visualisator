# Gaussian Sonificator / Visualisator  
Based on the gauss method (SuperCollder).  
1st and 2nd TouchOSC Sliders are controling the arguments (Gaussian receiver & Standard Deviation). The 3rd one controls the generation speed of the next value (fast - slow).
  
  
**Visuals (Open Frameworks) are based on Lewis Lepton's Example (Rectangle Loop).**
